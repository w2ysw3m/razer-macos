# Compatibility Matrix

[English](compatibility.md) | [繁體中文](compatibility.zh-Hant.md) | [简体中文](compatibility.zh-Hans.md)

[Back to README](../README.md)

This matrix is generated from the current `src/devices/*.json` catalog and the legacy Electron feature defaults in `src/main/feature/featurehelper.js`.

> Generated from 267 device JSON profiles.

## Support Boundary

- The legacy Electron app keeps the broad device catalog and historical feature model.
- The native SwiftUI/AppKit app is stricter: only hardware paths that are wired through the native C bridge and tested on macOS are listed as native verified.
- A listed legacy catalog feature means the configuration exists in this repository. It does not guarantee that every readback/write path works on every macOS version or every physical unit.

## Native Verified Target

| Device | Product ID | Native controls | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro | `0x00B7` | Discovery, DPI, polling rate, battery/status | Verified first target; readback can still time out on current hardware path |

## Legacy Catalog Summary

| Keyboards | 119 |
| Mouse mats | 8 |
| Mouse docks | 2 |
